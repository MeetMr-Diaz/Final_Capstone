Requirements (they are flexible and can be subject to modifications):
• GTA application submission portal.
• A web-based application that can collect applications online
• Nice to have a way to filter applicants based on courses they took, their qualifications (BS, MS,
PhD etc.), and grades they got in a certain course etc.
• Matching suitable applicants with open positions 
• CS HR people should be able assign a status to an application.
• The student should be able to modify an existing application after submission if allowed by the
CS HR people.
• It would be good if the students could set up conditions within the collection portal. For
instance, if an applicant says, he/she is not GTA certified, it would be good for the system to
only continue to the grader application (and, maybe also, provide a link to obtaining GTA
certification). Please see the GTA application for more information.
